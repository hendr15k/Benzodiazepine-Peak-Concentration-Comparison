## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of this project is currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please refrain from opening public issues or pull requests. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will strive to acknowledge your emailed report within 48 hours.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Email us at: hendrik.schmitz03.sh@gmail.com. Use "Security Vulnerability" as the subject line.

2. In the email, include a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please provide as much information as possible about the nature and impact of the vulnerability, the steps required to reproduce the issue.

We take all disclosures very seriously and will rapidly respond to confirm the receipt of your report. We will then undertake an internal investigation and determine an appropriate resolution.

Please note, our ability to respond to you or to remediate any vulnerability in a timely manner is directly correlated to the level of detail you provide.

## Policy Updates

This policy may be updated from time to time, reflecting the iterative improvement of our security procedures. Any significant changes will be announced via a news update on the project home page.
